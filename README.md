My Emacs 24 config files for Clojure and Ruby stuff.

*First Time Install*

1. Create a softlink to the `dot-emacs.d` directory in `~/.emacs.d`
2. Start the GUI Emacs app - it will take time to download/install extensions
3. Quit Emacs
4. Create a softlink to the file `dot-emacs.d/username.el` in `~/.emacs.d/${USER}.el`
5. Start Emacs again to see effect

*Upgrade*

1. Remove all files/folders except `init.el` and `username.el`
2. Follow the steps isted in *First Time Install*
